#### **Introduction:**
The aim of this project is to develop a deep learning model to accurately predict handwritten digits (0-9) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset used is the famous **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits, which contains images of digits in grayscale, each of size 28x28 pixels. This project will focus on building a CNN model capable of classifying these images into one of the ten possible digits.

#### **Project Objective:**
The main objectives of this project are:
- To build an image classification model that predicts the digits from images of handwritten numbers using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- To achieve high accuracy in classifying digits on the MNIST dataset.
- To evaluate the model's generalization capability by testing it on a validation dataset and making predictions for an unseen test dataset.

---

#### **Dataset:**
The project relies on the **MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset**, which consists of:
- **Training Data:** 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is 28x28 pixels (784 features).
- **Test Data:** 28,000 grayscale images (without labels) for testing the trained model.
- **Target Variable (Label):** The label associated with each image is the digit (0-9) represented in the image.

Each image is represented by pixel values in the range from 0 to 255, with higher values indicating darker pixels.

#### **Methodology:**

1. **Stage 1: Data Exploration (Data Exploration)**


2. **Stage 2: Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Normalization:** Normalize pixel values of images to the range $[0, 1]$ by dividing by $255$.
   - **Reshaping:** Reshape images into a $3D$ array $(28x28x1)$ as required by $CNN$ models.
   - **One-Hot Encoding:** Convert the digit labels into one-hot encoded vectors (e.g., digit 3 becomes $[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]$).

3. **Stage 3: Model Building:**
   - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Build a deep CNN model using the following layers:
     - **Conv2D**: Convolutional layers to extract features from images.
     - **MaxPooling2D**: Pooling layers to downsample the spatial dimensions.
     - **Flatten**: Flattening the $2D$ feature maps into $1D$ vector for dense layers.
     - **Dense**: Fully connected layers for classification.
   - **Activation Function:** Use **ReLU** activation for hidden layers and **Softmax** for the output layer to represent a probability distribution over the $10$ possible digits.

4. **Stage 4: Model Training:**
   - **Compilation:** Use **Categorical Cross-Entropy** as the loss function and **Adam Optimizer** with a learning rate of $0.001$.
   - **Training:** Train the model on the training set with early stopping (to prevent overfitting) and validate on the validation set.

5. **Stage 5: Model Evaluation:**
   - **Validation Accuracy:** Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using metrics like accuracy and loss.
   - **Confusion Matrix:** Analyze the model's performance with a confusion matrix to identify which digits are most often misclassified.

6. **Stage 6: Prediction and Submission:**
   - **Predict for Test Data:** Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set (which has no labels).
   - **Prepare Submission File:** Create a submission file in the format required (ImageId, Label) for evaluation on Kaggle or similar platforms.

#### **Proposed Models:**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** A deep learning model specifically designed for image classification. It includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to capture spatial hierarchies in images.
- **Fully Connected Neural Networks (optional):** A simpler model that could serve as a baseline to compare the performance of CNN. However, CNNs are expected to outperform FCNs for image recognition tasks.
- **Pre-trained Networks (optional):** Models like **LeNet**, **ResNet**, or **VGG** that could be fine-tuned on the MNIST dataset.

#### **Techniques and Tools:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation.
  - **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training CNN models.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization and plotting.
  - **Scikit-learn** for model evaluation metrics like confusion matrix and accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Techniques:**
  - **Supervised Learning** (classification).
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image classification.

---

#### **Expected Outcomes:**
- **High Accuracy:** The model is expected to achieve an accuracy of over $98$% on the test set, similar to state-of-the-art results on the MNIST dataset.
- **Key Insights:** The model will highlight how well CNNs perform for image recognition tasks, and may provide insights into common misclassifications for certain digits (e.g., misclassifying '3' and '5').

---

#### **Challenges:**
- **Overfitting:** Although CNNs are powerful, overfitting can occur, especially if the model is too complex for the data. Regularization techniques like dropout or early stopping will be used to mitigate this risk.
- **Class Imbalance:** The dataset may exhibit slight class imbalance, though MNIST is relatively balanced. Still, it's important to monitor performance on each digit class.
- **Computation Resources:** Training CNNs can be computationally expensive, and access to a machine with a GPU will speed up the training process.

---

#### **Expected Results:**
- **Trained Model:** A CNN model trained to recognize handwritten digits with **high accuracy**.
- **Evaluation:** Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and possibly other metrics like $F1-score$ for balanced evaluation.
- **Insights:** Understand which digits are commonly misclassified and explore model performance across different digits.

---

### **Conclusion:**
This project aims to build a robust CNN-based model capable of classifying handwritten digits accurately. By utilizing deep learning techniques, the model will be able to learn spatial hierarchies in images, enabling it to achieve high classification accuracy. The insights derived from the model could be valuable for similar image recognition tasks, demonstrating the power of Convolutional Neural Networks in computer vision.
